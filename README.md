Name: Storyteller

Storyteller is a website that lets you create your own choose-your-own-adventure style story.

Once you create your account, you can create a story, at which point you will be free to edit that story's 'starter card'. 
You can create 'children' cards of each card, which will manifest as your 'choices' and serve as your navigation tools throughout the story.
These choices will be listed at the bottom of each card (in both the 'editor' and the 'viewer') and can be clicked to take you to the card associated with that choice.

Each card can be renamed or deleted. You can only have up to 5 'child' cards (ie 5 choices) for each story card.

You can also view stories that other users have created, either by browsing the stories (split by genre) or by a search function. 
The search function allows you to search by either story name or story description.
